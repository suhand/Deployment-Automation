This main script is the first script is being invoked for Deployment
Automation. Following tasks are performed,
  * Check which IaaS to be used based on the [environment] env value
    of deployment.cfg (Current implementation is for OpenStack).
  * Get environment specific configuration information.
  * Load cluster node data.
  * Spawn instances in OpenStack.
  * Get facter information from instances and update puppet templates.
TODO 
  * Implement for EC2, Physical machines, Local
  * Evaluate and implement docker based deployment automation
